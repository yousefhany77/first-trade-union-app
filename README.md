I developed a Docker-based system for a financial services company to track bonds and certificates, calculate ROI, and filter and query investor data. The company had been using a manual process for these tasks, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. By implementing a new algorithm, I improved the accuracy of ROI calculations by 20% and reduced errors. I also reduced the time required to calculate the ROI of all investors by 50% and the time required to calculate the maturity value of each bond by 75%, resulting in faster and more accurate reporting. Finally, I streamlined the reporting process by generating Excel reports automatically, resulting in a 40% reduction in reporting time. The system has significantly improved the company's efficiency, accuracy, and reporting capabilities, making it a valuable asset in the financial services industry.
